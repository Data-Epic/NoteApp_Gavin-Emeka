### Week 2 Task - Beginners with Experience.

## Of all the Ups and Downs that this task has taken me through, My greatest Joy is that I could  do something genuinely without using ChatGPT. I guess its a big one for me.

## QST.1: I was able to create the Parent Class, NOTE, and used constructors to set up all the attributes that the class could have. I was also able to create differnt Object using the class.

## QST.2: I was able to extend my base class, to create subclasses that would inherit its Properties.The TextNote and the ReminderNote.

#### Couldn't attempt the other questions due to poor knowledge of it, and the time left, until submission.

### I'm very much open to reviews and corrections, on the next steps better steps to take.
